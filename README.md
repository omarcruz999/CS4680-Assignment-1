Model Evaluation:

The classification model was more suitable for this problem because it is naturally a classification 
problem since we are sorting emails into two categories. Linear regression does not fit well with 
this problem because it is used for predicting a continuous number. Forcing the model's output into a category
can lead to less reliable results as shown in the program's output.
